	<p>Zanzibar City, a low lying city off coast Tanzania enjoys a historic heritage and functions as a hub of business and administration for Zanzibar isles.  However, as a highly dense city in the East Africa region, (539 inhabitants/km2) and poor infrastructure and unplanned areas in some places, the city is faced with a cyclic problem of urban flooding. The urban flooding has multiplier effects on people’s health, economy and the social interaction. For instance, the habitual urban flooding is correlated with cholera outbreaks in the fringes of the city, which happens nearly every year. Moreover, urban infrastructures are severely damaged by these floods and the households in the vulnerable zones subjected to harsh disturbance during rains causing deaths, property destruction and people displacement.</p>
	<p>The Zanzibar Urban Planning Department, Zanzibar Commission for Disasters as well as Municipal councils are engaging in sustainable planning in an attempt to reduce impacts related from these recurring floods and enhance city’s resilience.</p>
	<p>The key project objective is to contribute to the development of Zanzibar urban resilience from urban flooding through creation of ready to use information to aid the spatial planning process and interventions. Specific questions addressed include identification of flood prone areas, development of index of the exposure to vulnerability; zoning, classification of urban roads with the respect to their difficulty in accessibility and movement through public roads (floods block the roads), identification the number of houses affected; classification of the type of facilities e.g. public, household, commercial, affected and classification the types of zoning areas where these house are found (formal, informal, planned/not planned).</p>
	<p>There is huge economic and social significance of engaging in project like this because every year the government weather through the direct funding or based on donor funding spends money to fight against various impacts of flooding in all of Zanzibar and in Zanzibar City in particular. Such recurring hazard incidents creates disruption of systems in place, notable the road and waterways and sewage, houses especially of the low income people in the vulnerable areas in the City.</p>
	<p>The additional burden of health related epidemics (cholera and dysentery) poses significant stresses on the few resources available. While the information system required to effectively management these issues is disjointed, it is very true that even the available spatial based information are not fully being utilized, even if much efforts to create the data have been undertaken in the past.</p>
	<p>This project comes with intervention, which is necessary towards effective planning and administration of various interventions made such as those mentioned in the previous section. The execution of this project  adds value to what Rural and Urban Department aspires to do, which is creating accessible spatial data and make the use of them in planning and addressing various problems affecting our City, including those caused by urban flooding. This project will be undertaken jointly, and relies very much on the input of different stakeholders and the community. The communities are expected to benefit through availability of the relevant data about the flooding which includes hotspots and vulnerability situations.</p>
	<p>The chain of stakeholders involves institutions and people at the core and those affecting, being affected or benefiting or contributing to the course of interventions of this project.</p>
