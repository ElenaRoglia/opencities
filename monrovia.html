	<p>The city of Monrovia in Liberia is a peninsular area of land bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and the narrow Mesurado and Saint Paul rivers to the north with a population of 1.3 million inhabitants. These rivers open north of Monrovia’s largest slum, West Point, home to approximately 75,000 residents and several other numbers of unplanned settlements along the north banks which are populated with mangroves swamp or wetland. Many of these settlements are located in lowlands, waterways and wetlands. The unplanned settlements grew densely populated during Liberia’s fourteen-year civil crisis during which period most rural dwellers relocated to the capital to seek employment, education, better trading opportunities and security in addition to pre-war population growth.</p>
	<p>Because the capital is small geographically, coupled with urban planning that didn’t take into consideration population growth and migration, this hugely attributed to the overpopulation in this small city. As a result, low income earners and lack of proper implementation of zoning regulations, a lot of makeshift (zinc, wood or clay) structures were erected in unsanitary environments.</p>
	<p>Monrovia, like all other developing cities, population increase is accompanied by issues such as flooding (rivers are rising above normal levels, drainages are blocked), erosion (ocean rise, mudslide, heavy rain), pollution (waste management, air, sewage) and wind storms (tropical rains with heavy wind and storms), deforestation (cutting of trees to make farms or expansion of towns) are devastating results of climate change.</p>
	<p>Under the Open Cities Participatory Mapping project, we have considered flooding as a priority because it affects most communities (planned and unplanned), in which homes get flooded, streets are blocked creating huge traffic congestions, trade is stalled because businesses either are unable to open their doors or goods are damaged. Therefore, tackling flooding is indirectly related to erosion and pollution which are hugely faced by communities in Central Monrovia and its environs. From experiences over the years, Clara Town and Doe Community in Monrovia City are the most affected areas during the rainy season.</p>
	<p>Flooding in Monrovia is cyclical, occurs during the rainy season (April - October), and for most communities, August to September is the period where Monrovia experiences very heavy rainfalls causing rivers to overflow, drainages clogged, waterways blocked and in wetlands, water comes from beneath the grounds. From government data, it is predictable that flooding will occur as with every year in communities identified in our problem statement. However, we therefore hope our up-to-date datasets on flooding will help government and development partners to make more refined policies around causes of flooding, beit man-made or climate change to design programs that would minimize or eradicate future occurrences.</p>
	<p>Because flooding occurs during the rainy season, we hope to collect accurate and verified data during this period in order for interventions to occur during the dry season when there are no obstacles to building drainages, clearing waterways, breakpoints, creating awareness, educating the communities and adapting other measures like relocating the most deplorable communities.</p>
