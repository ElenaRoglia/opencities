				<p>Coauthored with <a href="http://www.hot.openstreetmap.org">The Humanitarian Open StreetMap Team</a> and with input from all Open Cities partners, this guide offers a comprehensive understanding of the design and implementation of an Open Cities mapping project for both practitioners in the field and those interested in a higher-level understanding of the process. The guide's content is based on experience in implementing the initial Open Cities projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka as well as on previous mapping project experience. Where relevant, it provides relevant examples from those projects in the text and full case studies at the end of guide.</p>
