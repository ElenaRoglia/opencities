<h3>Data Quality</h3>
<span>While OSM coverage keeps increasing, it's important to also understand quality of the data created. The tools available in this section allow for comparing OSM data with other "reference" datasets. These could be, for example, official datasets from government agencies showing distribution of features with those available OSM. The "Gap Detection" widget provides a visual representation of potential gaps in data, by comparing the latest OSM buildings with built-up areas automatically detected from satellite imagery.</span>
