	<p>The Open Cities Accra Project seeks to make Alogboshie and its environs resilient to natural disasters, especially flooding. The project will also involve the remote mapping of Nima, Akweteman and Alajo. These are areas of focus in a larger resilience project, GARID, and are all located along the Osaw River which is prone to floods.</p>
	<p>Alogboshie is a community that is plagued by perennial flooding, its indigenes and those in neighboring communities are mostly affected by this. The area is usually flooded in the months of June and July because the rainy season is at its peak then.</p>
	<p>The effect of the flood on human life in the community is huge. Often after floods, some indigenes of the community are displaced due to the loss of property. Also, this community being a slum makes it prone to disease outbreaks and the spread of contagious diseases because of the poor planning of physical structures there. Lives are being lost yearly, properties are being destroyed, diseases are spreading rapidly.</p>
	<p>Open Cities Accra will address these problems by providing a detailed and accurate map of the area and capacity building for the various stakeholders in the government institutions. These stakeholders include the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, Ghana Statistical Services, Metropolitan and Municipal District Assemblies, Ministry of Inner Cities Development and Zongos, National Disaster Management Organization etc.</p>
	<p>The Alogboshie community will benefit a lot from this project as the results will help in planning the area and also inform disaster relief agencies in determining the number of relief services they need to send there.</p>
	<p>Government agencies like the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, National Disaster Management Organization and the various Municipal and Metropolitan Assemblies stand to benefit a lot because their work becomes a lot easier with the maps that will be produced after the project. This will help them make data-driven decisions which have the tendency to affect the lives of indigenes more positively.</p>
	<p>We will train staff members of these institutions to ensure continuity of the mapping practice we have introduced them to.</p>
