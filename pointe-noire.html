	<p>Pointe Noire is built on a coastal swampy flat land; thus, the entire city faces flood issues after most heavy rains. But the most threatened areas are precarious and over-populated districts such as Mboukou and Tchiniambi1. These two districts are threatened by recurrent floods, soil erosion, waste management issues, underground water and riversâ€™ pollution and public health issues including malaria and water-related diseases. Infrastructure and development projects are being implemented to tackle these issues, but they lack the necessary maps, data and tools to ensure their success and the coordination of the different projects.</p>
	<p>The Town council of Pointe Noire and the borough councils lack accurate data usable for a sound and informed decision making related to urban development. The population and community leaders of the two districts need to be involved and trained to collective actions to enable the follow-up and maintenance of public goods.</p>
