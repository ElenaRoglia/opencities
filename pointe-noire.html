	<p>Pointe Noire is built on a coastal swampy flat land; thus, the entire city faces flood issues after most heavy rains. But the most threatened areas are precarious and over-populated districts such as Mboukou and Tchiniambi1. These two districts are threatened by recurrent floods, soil erosion, waste management issues, underground water and riversâ€™ pollution and public health issues including malaria and water-related diseases. Infrastructure and development projects are being implemented to tackle these issues, but they lack the necessary maps, data and tools to ensure their success and the coordination of the different projects.</p>
	<p>The Town council of Pointe Noire and the borough councils lack accurate data usable for a sound and informed decision making related to urban development. The population and community leaders of the two districts need to be involved and trained to collective actions to enable the follow-up and maintenance of public goods.</p>
	<h3>Mapping Progress to Date</h3>
	<span>This section provides an overview of mapping activities in the selected city geographic extent. The Before/After widget below allows comparing current density and distribution of map features with snapshots from previous years. The time chart of OSM editing activity over time offers insights on how many features have been contributed to the map over a specified period.</span>

	<h3>Data Quality</h3>
	<span>While OSM coverage keeps increasing, it's important to also understand quality of the data created. The tools available in this section allow for comparing OSM data with other "reference" datasets. These could be, for example, official datasets from government agencies showing distribution of features with those available OSM. The "Gap Detection" widget provides a visual representation of potential gaps in data, by comparing the latest OSM buildings with built-up areas automatically detected from satellite imagery.</span>
