	<p>The city of Ngaoundere is facing recurring challenges related to urban floods, which are increasing as its uncontrolled urbanization continues. Urbanization has been largely spontaneous, resulting from the increasing occupation of many flood or wetlands and mountain slopes without adequate land management.</p>
	<p>To improve the management of its territory, the Urban Community of Ngaoundere (UCN), in collaboration with the Inclusive and Resilient Cities Development Project (IRCDP) financed by the World Bank via the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MINHUD), must update spatial data in open access on the built space and the essential infrastructures located in areas at risk of floods and landslides, in neighborhoods like Sabongari III, Sabongari Norvegien, Baladji I, Joli Soir, Djalingo and Gadamabanga.</p>
	<p>The city of Ngaoundéré having been chosen for the pilot project of implementation of the Open Cities Initiative in Africa, the university community and local community organizations will be involved in all stages of the collaborative mapping campaign. The data thus generated will enable municipal and local authorities to better plan urban growth, land use, urban development and the various interventions in the city in the event of floods and landslides. In the long term, Ngaoundere will be able to serve as an example of success, for its neighboring localities, in urban planning and computer-aided management of natural disasters (floods, landslides, etc.).</p>
	<h3>Mapping Progress to Date</h3>
	<span>This section provides an overview of mapping activities in the selected city geographic extent. The Before/After widget below allows comparing current density and distribution of map features with snapshots from previous years. The time chart of OSM editing activity over time offers insights on how many features have been contributed to the map over a specified period.</span>

	<h3>Data Quality</h3>
	<span>While OSM coverage keeps increasing, it's important to also understand quality of the data created. The tools available in this section allow for comparing OSM data with other "reference" datasets. These could be, for example, official datasets from government agencies showing distribution of features with those available OSM. The "Gap Detection" widget provides a visual representation of potential gaps in data, by comparing the latest OSM buildings with built-up areas automatically detected from satellite imagery.</span>
